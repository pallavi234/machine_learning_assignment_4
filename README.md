#### Programming elements:
  1. **Linear Regression** 
  
  2. **K-Means Clustering**  
  
  3. **Data Analysis**
    
#### In class programming:
    1. Apply Linear Regression to the provided dataset using underlying steps.
        - Import the given “Salary_Data.csv”
        - Split the data in train_test partitions, such that 1/3 of the data is reserved as test subset.
        - Train and predict the model.
        - Calculate the mean_squared error
        - Visualize both train and test data using scatter plot.
        
    2. Apply K means clustering in the dataset provided:
        - Remove any null values by the mean.
        - Use the elbow method to find a good number of clusters with the K-Means algorithm
        - Calculate the silhouette score for the above clustering
        
    3. Try feature scaling and then apply K-Means on the scaled features. Did that improve the Silhouette score?
        - If Yes, can you justify why
